# Pearl-API

## WHAT IS PEARL
Development in Unity for a long time and during these years I have created different classes to simplify the management and creation of games.

Pearl is the set of my knowledge: a framework that facilitates the development of Unity making the architecture of the game very modular and therefore less affected by errors.

Pearl uses the updated version of NET (4.0); therefore, lower NET version will not make the framework work.
To view a demo in Unity, view this repository: https://github.com/AmalfiZodiaco/Pearl-Demo
The demo was performed on the LSV version of Unity 2017.
